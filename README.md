Hello.

   This project is being built with the main intention of studying and strengthening my front-end skills, however, if you deem the final result polished and interesting enough, it could be used for reference and inspiration if you are looking for something related with CSS border-radius shapes.

   My main inspiration for this project came when i was using 9Elements's wonderful generator (https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/#80.65.58.18--.), i thought that it could be interesting to have a sorta like gallery to get those fancy shapes right off the bat.
