Greetings!

    This project was built with the main purpose of studying and strengthening my 
    front-end skills, however, if you deem the final result polished and appealing, 
    it could be used for reference and inspiration if you are looking for something 
    along these lines.

    The due credits for the authors of code snippets/art/other projects i used as inspiration for this one
    can be found in the Footer.
